Solution I came up with.

1st Test Case:
```
-> num = 4, t =1;
Here the answer is 6.

4+1 = 5
6-1 = 5 //to find 6, use the formula.

4 + 2x1 = 6;

|~|~|~|+>|<-|~|~|~|
1~2~3~4~~5~~6~7~8~9
```

2st Test Case:
```
-> num = 3, t =2;
Here the answer is 7.

3+2 = 5
7-2 = 5 //to find 5, use the formula.

3 + 2x2 = 7;

|~|~|+>|+>|<-|<-|-|-|
1~2~3~~4~~5~~6~~7~8~9
```

We need to skip 2 time of (t) ahead in the number line,
hence the formula for this --> [Num + 2*t = x].
